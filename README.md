The IDE to edit and run Sikuli scripts (supported scripting languages Python/Jython).
<br /><br />
**MANDATORY ;-)** [Have a look at major improvements and new features](https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-IDE/wiki/Release-Notes-IDE)
<br /><br />
SikuliX-IDE is targeted at people who want to develop and run scripts using Sikuli features with one of the supported scripting languages.
<br /><br />
For the use of Sikuli features in Java programs, other Java based languages or Java aware scripting languages currently not supported by SikuliX-IDE you should use SikuliX-API (https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API). 

Same goes for people who want to develop, run and debug scripts using SikuliX-IDE supported scripting languages in other IDE's like Eclipse, Netbeans, ...
<br /><br />
The downloadable packages of SikuliX-IDE contain everything needed <br />
including a current version of SikuliX-API (https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API).

**History**
 - this is based on the developement at MIT (Tsung-Hsiang Chang (Sean aka vgod) and Tom Yeh) which was discontinued end 2011 (https://github.com/sikuli/sikuli) with a latest version called Sikuli X-1.0r930 (http://www.sikuli.org).
 - and the follow up repo https://github.com/RaiMan/Sikuli12.11, where I prepared the creation of a final version 1.0
 - in April 2013 I decided, to divide Sikuli X into the 2 packages SikuliX-IDE (this repo) and SikuliX-API (https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API), to better support future contributions.

**Support**
 - until otherwise noted: questions, requests and bugs can be posted at https://answers.launchpad.net/sikuli
 - the wiki in this repo will be used extensively to document anything (taking over this roll from the webpage and lauchpad)
 - you might always post an issue with any content in this repo of course

**Contribution**
 - pull requests are always welcome, but must be with reference to the development branch (beginning mid June 2013)
 - everyone is welcome to add interesting stuff, experiences, solutions to the wiki in this repo
