**History**
 - this is based on the developement at MIT (Tsung-Hsiang Chang (Sean aka vgod) and Tom Yeh) which was discontinued end 2011 (https://github.com/sikuli/sikuli) with a latest version called Sikuli X-1.0r930 (http://www.sikuli.org).
 - and the follow up repo https://github.com/RaiMan/Sikuli12.11, where I prepared the creation of a final version 1.0
 - in April 2013 I decided, to finally divide Sikuli X into the 2 packages SikuliX-IDE (this repo) and SikuliX-API (https://github.com/RaiMan/SikuliX-API), to better support future contributions.
